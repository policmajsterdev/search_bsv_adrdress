A small python program that reads data from the Bitcoin SV (BSV) blockchain.

After starting:
- checks connection with API (WhatsOnChain and NBP)
- displays information such as: current rate, supply, total fee, block size in MB

The program is used to search for transactions and addresses in issued transactions.
When the program finishes searching, it restarts and you can continue searching the addresses.
